Projects done during the Piscine according to the challenges proposed during the Piscine. The codes were formatted according to the guidelines and restrictions of the school's standards.

Some projects contain exercises that were not submitted.

**Attention! To Pisciners who found this repository searching for answers to solve the projects, I ask that you first try to solve them on your own and with your cluster peers, try again, again, and again. Keep swimming!** 🏊 🏊 🏊
